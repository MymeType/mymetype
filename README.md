# hai :3
my name is mymetype and this is my profile. i am an aspiring developer and a fedora linux enthusiast (currently daily driving fedora sway atomic rn). currently learning website development and python (and maybe java or c++ in the future).

you can find me in most social media under the username `@mymetype`.

i am also a huge enjoyer of axolotls btw :3 (and by enjoyer i mean having a linux distro named after them and an axolotl fursona)

feel free to check any shitty programs that i may make from time to time!
